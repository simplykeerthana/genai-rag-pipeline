Mission Statement
The OWASP Gen AI Security Project is a global, open-source initiative dedicated to identifying, mitigating, and documenting security and safety risks associated with generative AI technologies, including large language models (LLMs), agentic AI systems, and AI-driven applications. Our mission is to empower organizations, security professionals, AI practitioners, and policymakers with comprehensive, actionable guidance and tools to ensure the secure development, deployment, and governance of generative AI systems.
Project Objectives
Risk Identification & Documentation
Maintain and evolve the
OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications
, providing a structured framework for understanding generative AI’s most critical security risks.
Research and document emerging threats, adversarial attack techniques, and potential vulnerabilities specific to AI models and applications.
Security Best Practices & Mitigations
Develop practical security recommendations and blueprints for securing AI-driven applications.
Provide governance frameworks, compliance guidelines, safety and risk management strategies tailored for AI security.
Maintain and expand resources like
AI Security Solutions Landscape
, a curated repository of security tools, and frameworks, updated quarterly.
Applied Research & Community Collaboration
Foster research initiatives such as
AI Red Teaming & Evaluation
,
Securing AI-driven Exploit Generation
, and
Agentic AI Security
to explore attack surfaces and mitigation strategies.
Collaborate with academic institutions, industry leaders, and government agencies to drive AI security research and regulatory alignment.
Education, Training, & Knowledge Sharing
Provide publicly accessible security resources, training materials, and open-source tools to support AI security education.
Translate key security documents into multiple languages to ensure accessibility for a global audience.
Engage security professionals and AI engineers through working groups, webinars, and industry events.
Enterprise Adoption & AI Governance
Develop and maintain resources to support practitioners and executives alike such as the
CISO AI Security Checklist
, offering structured guidance for enterprises integrating generative AI into business workflows.
Support organizations in building AI security governance programs through resources like the
OWASP AI Security Center of Excellence (CoE) Guide
.
Provide CISOs and security leaders with governance roadmaps and risk assessment methodologies.
Core Principles
Open & Collaborative:
The project thrives on global contributions from AI and security experts across industries, academia, and government sectors.
Transparency & Accessibility:
All research outputs are open-source, peer-reviewed, and freely available to ensure widespread adoption and continuous improvement.
Practical & Actionable Guidance:
The project focuses on producing hands-on, implementable security solutions rather than theoretical frameworks.
Ethical AI Security Advocacy:
Promote responsible AI development and deployment by addressing ethical concerns, bias mitigation, and adversarial misuse.
Project Structure & Participation
The OWASP Gen AI Security Project operates as a decentralized, community-driven initiative. Participation is open to:
AI security researchers, engineers, and practitioners.
Organizations integrating generative AI technologies.
Cybersecurity professionals, red teamers, and AI governance experts.
Policymakers, regulators, and compliance officers who are involved in AI risk management.
Get Involved
The OWASP Gen AI Security Project welcomes contributors from around the world. Whether you’re an AI researcher, security expert, or industry professional, you can help advance AI security by:
Contributing to research and documentation efforts.
Participating in working groups and discussions.
Providing real-world case studies and mitigation strategies.
Supporting localization efforts to expand access to AI security guidance.
