Branding and Logo Usage Guidelines

OWASP Foundations branding guidelines
(read these first) which also apply to this project.
Statement of Non-Endorsement
OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications and Generative AI security does not endorse any product, services, or tools. The following disclaimer/About OWASP text can be used in projects or press releases that reference external products, services, or tools.
