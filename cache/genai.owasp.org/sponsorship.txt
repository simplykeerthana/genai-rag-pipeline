Getting Started
The OWASP GenAI Security project is a community-driven effort open to anyone who wants to contribute. The project is a non-profit effort and sponsorship helps to ensure the project’s success by providing the resources to maximize the value community contributions bring to the overall project. Funding received is applied to help cover resources, operations, outreach and education costs.
In exchange, the project offers a number of benefits to recognize the company’s contributions including project logo placement, branding and promotional opportunities from our media partners. Sponsorship does not impact project governance, which remains open and unbiased.
Why Are We Seeking Sponsorship
The OWASP Foundation does provide the project with operational resources to support the project. However it is limited. Through sponsorship we aim to ensure the OWASP GenAI Security project has the resources necessary to empower our large collaborative community to continue to provide the industry with the latest research insights and guidance to securing generative AI/LLM systems and applications to address the evolving landscape, in an open and transparent way to benefit the industry.
The funding also goes to support specific project
Initiatives
and research projects to help gather data and enhance security for LLM and Generative AI applications. Some example
Initiatives
include supporting our Data Gathering Initiative, as well as LLM Red Teaming Research.
