Project Governance
Introduction
The Gen AI Security Project (Top 10 for LLM and Gen AI ) governance model is based on the
Meritocratic governance model
by Ross Gardler and Gabriel Hanganu. And is licensed under the
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License
.
This governance model outlines the structure and roles within the Project, ensuring transparency, fairness, and efficiency in decision-making while fostering a thriving and collaborative open-source ecosystem.
Roles and Responsibilities
The governance model is based on a meritocratic system, where contributions, expertise, and sustained participation determine decision-making authority and leadership roles.
Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors (BoD) serves as the highest decision-making body, ensuring the long-term sustainability and strategic alignment of the project.
Membership:
Anyone can become a member; there are no special requirements, other than to have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the project as a team player, demonstrate subject matter expertise, and be recognized as providing significant strategic and material contributions to the project.
Responsibilities:
Establish and uphold the vision, mission, and values of the project.
Approve budgets, financial plans, and funding allocations.
Resolve disputes and make final decisions on governance and project matters.
Appoint or confirm leadership roles within the project.
Represent the project to external stakeholders, including sponsors and partners.
Term and Appointment
2 year staggered terms to ensure board continuity
Elected by a Simple Majority of the current BoD and CPMT members
Members can be removed by a ⅔ majority vote of the board.
Term and Appointment
No specific term is currently determined, though the desired term is 1 year.
Appointed by the board of directors
Successfully propose new initiative for the project
Removal by ⅔ majority of the board.
Core Project Management Team
The Core Project Management Team (CPMT) is responsible for the project’s ongoing management, coordination, and development. The core team members are expected to review code contributions, participate in strategic planning, approve changes to the governance model and manage the copyrights within the project outputs.
Members of the Core Team do not have significant authority over other members of the community, although it is the CPMT that votes on new team members and project Initiatives. See Initiatives, for further details.
Anyone can become a member; there are no special requirements, other than to have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the project as a team player. Typically, a potential member will need to show that they have an understanding of the project, its objectives and its strategy. They will also have provided valuable contributions to the project over a period of time.
Core project team members are made up of actively contributing project members who  are either/or:
Operational or Technical Lead fulfilling a specific role –  appointed by the board
Initiative lead (manages a specific approved project initiative)
Responsibilities:
Maintain project infrastructure and ensure operational continuity.
Oversee contributions, code quality, and project roadmaps.
Communicate important project updates to the community.
Approve new Initiatives
Term and Appointment
No specific term is currently determined, though the desired term is 1 year.
Appointed by the board of directors
Successfully propose new initiative for the project
Removal by ⅔ majority of the board.
Community Members and Contributors
Members and Contributors play vital roles in the project’s ecosystem, Anyone can become a member; there are no special requirements, other than to have shown a willingness and ability to participate in the project as a team player. Typically, a potential member will need to show that they have an understanding of the project, its objectives and its strategy. Below we outline the potential roles and responsibilities members can take within the community.
Users
Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community and without them the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.
The project asks its users to participate in the project and community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users.
Contributors
Contributors are community members who contribute in concrete and substantial ways to the project. Anyone can become a contributor, and contributions can take many forms. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process..
Reviewers
Reviewers primarily focus on reviewing contributions and providing feedback as part of an initiative, committee or working group.
Experts
Expert contributors are individuals with specialized knowledge in critical domains such as cybersecurity, generative AI, or other fields necessary to support the goals of specific working groups or committees and have shown continued significant contribution to the project.
Expert Review Board
An expert review board is a designated set of distinguished experts who may not be traditional contributors but may bring specific expertise to be used as a sounding board or help to validate output from an Initiative. An initiative lead may form a review board based on the needs of their Initiative.
Committees / Working Groups
Working Groups are formed at the direction of the BoD and support specific initiatives or committees. Anyone can join a working group and offer to contribute their time and expertise in alignment with the charter and focus for the Initiative or committee.
Decision-Making Process
Decisions are made based on merit, expertise, and consensus. Decisions about the future of the project are made through discussion with all members of the community, from the newest user to the most experienced Core Team member. All non-sensitive project management discussion takes place on the project contributors’ Slack. Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs on a private list.
The following principles guide the decision-making process:
Consensus-based decision-making: Discussions aim to achieve general agreement among stakeholders.
Escalation protocol: If consensus cannot be reached, the decision is escalated to the Initiative Lead, then the Core Project Management Team, and, if necessary, the Board of Directors.
Transparency: All major decisions are documented and shared publicly.
In order to ensure that the project is not bogged down by endless discussion and continual voting, the project operates a policy of lazy consensus. This allows the majority of decisions to be made without resorting to a formal vote.
Lazy Consensus
Lazy consensus decision making typically involves the following steps. Proposal,  Discussion, Vote (if consensus is not reached through discussion), Decision.
Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community. In order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should send a slack to the project contributors’ list or submit a patch implementing the idea to the issue tracker. This will prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and discussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most people in the project community have a shared vision, there is often little need for discussion in order to reach consensus
For lazy consensus to be effective, it is necessary to allow at least 72 hours before assuming that there are no objections to the proposal.  This requirement ensures that everyone is given enough time to read, digest and
respond to the proposal. This time period is chosen so as to be as inclusive as possible of all participants, regardless of their location and time commitments.
Voting
Not all decisions can be made using lazy consensus. Issues such as those affecting the strategic direction or legal standing of the project must gain explicit approval in the form of a vote. Every member of the community is encouraged to express their opinions in all discussions and all votes. However, only project Initiative Leads, CPMT, and/or BoD members (as defined above) have binding votes for the purposes of decision making.
Unless otherwise specified, decisions by vote at a meeting will require a simple  majority vote, provided quorum is met. Decisions by electronic vote without a meeting will require a majority of all voting representatives.
Quorum for the BoD and CPMT is 51% or more of the total group present, for decision making Votes.
Contribution Guidelines
Anyone can contribute to the project, regardless of their skills, as there are many ways to contribute. For instance, a contributor might be active on the project slack and issue tracker, or might supply patches.
Contributors and reviewers will be acknowledged by being listed in the published work they contributed to or reviewed.
Project Initiatives
“Initiatives” within the project refer to structured activities that align with the project’s goals and objectives while extending its scope through various deliverables or contributions. These initiatives, such as research collaborations or methodology development, operate under the project banner but have flexibility in defining their own outputs, which may include whitepapers, code, workshops, or other resources.
The governance process requires submitting a proposal detailing goals, deliverables, team members, and resource needs, followed by core team review and a voting process for approval. Once approved, initiatives must adhere to reporting responsibilities, including bi-weekly updates and active collaboration within designated channels.
Initiative Lead
Initiative Leads manage specific  major initiatives (focused working groups) within the project. See the initiative governance guidelines for details on Initiative governance.
Responsibilities:
Define goals, roadmaps, and deliverables for their respective initiatives.
Coordinate with contributors, reviewers, and working groups.
Ensure timely execution of tasks within their initiative.
Regularly report progress to the Core Project Management Team and on the bi-weekly Open project review meetings.
Appointment:
Initiative leads are appointed based on a successful proposal, vote and approval of a new project initiative.
Initiative leaders can be removed by a 2/3rds majority vote of the Core Project Management Team,  or the board of directors.
Initiative Governance
The general process for submission, review and approval requires creation of an initiative proposal, identification of the core contributing team members, and a roadmap of  deliverables which is reviewed by the project core team and put to a open vote of the core team after review and any refinement of the proposal doc to confirm approval of the project.
Initial Submission
Complete Initiative Proposal One/Two Pager
The first step for each initiative is to create a version of the initiative proposal document that outlines the goals, objectives, specific outcomes and/or artifacts and a roadmap.
Include the name of the individual or individuals if proposing jointly.
Initiative costs, if required. All initiatives should have a $0 version of the proposal.
Resourcing: identify existing execution team, if there is one or if there is need for recruitment.
Proposal Starter Template:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eaBbc_oVZISrNkp-VDgU4oRohV1cbbJGyNWPIhVT4kE/edit?usp=sharing
Proposal Review
Proposal to be reviewed by the core team for initiative alignment, evaluate and review resourcing, recruitment needs and any funding requirements, if requested.
There may be requests to modify the proposal made by core team members.
There will be a goal for a fixed period for review to not exceed 4 weeks, unless changes and change requests require additional research and development.
Final Reviewed Submission
Revised initiative proposal is submitted for approval.
Share to the CPMT #team-llm-core. channel
Approval Requirements
Reviewed Initiative Final Proposal, Committed Roadmap & Dates
Identified core contribution and development team resources
Must meet minimally viable # of contributors to meet committed roadmap deliverables  and deadlines.
Budget requirement/requests (testing infrastructure, sw  licensing, etc)
Approval Process
Simple majority vote of the CPMT members and BoD.
The vote remains open for 72 hours to allow time for review and support globally distributed teams.
Retirement of an Initiative
An initiative may be retired if its lead steps down and no replacement is found or if it becomes inactive. The Board will decide in either case.
